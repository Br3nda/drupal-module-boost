REQUIREMENTS
------------
This version of Boost is designed for Drupal 6.x running on a Unix platform.
Drupal's clean URLs MUST be enabled and working properly.

The `path' and `pathauto' modules are recommended.

In order for the static files to be correctly expired, the Drupal cron job
must be correctly setup to execute more often than, or as often as, the
cache lifetime interval you specify.

Since the static page caching is implemented with mod_rewrite directives,
Apache version 1.3 or 2.x with mod_rewrite enabled is required (if Drupal's
clean URLs work for you, you're fine; if not, get them working first).
Other web servers, such as Lighttpd, are NOT supported at present.

INSTALLATION
------------

  1. Go to [Administer >> Site configuration >> Clean URLs] and ensure that
     Drupal's clean URLs are enabled and working correctly on your site.

  2. Copy all the module files into a subdirectory called
     sites/all/modules/boost/ under your Drupal installation directory.

  3. Go to [Administer >> Site building >> Modules] and enable the Boost
     module. You will find it in the section labelled "Caching".

  4. Go to [Administer >> Site configuration >> Performance], specify the
     cache directory (must be writable by the web server) and enable static
     caching.

  5. Log out from Drupal (or use another browser) to browse around your site
     as the anonymous user. Ensure that static files are indeed being
     generated into the Boost cache directory you specified above.

  6. IMPORTANT: after backing up the original .htaccess file in your Drupal
     installation directory, replace it with the template file from
     sites/all/modules/boost/htaccess/boosted1.txt, customizing the
     mod_rewrite rules to your particular setup if needed. (If you fail to
     do this, static page caching will NOT work!)

     Note that there is in the same directory also another .htaccess
     template called boosted2.txt. Should you have any trouble getting
     static pages served using the boosted1.txt configuration, do try this
     other file before posting a support issue on drupal.org.

     (For the technically inclined, the difference between the two supplied
     .htaccess templates is due to boosted1.txt relying on SERVER_NAME
     versus boosted2.txt using HTTP_HOST. There exist valid use cases for
     both, especially in more advanced, multi-site Drupal installations.)

  7. (See README.txt for information on submitting bug reports.)
