REQUIREMENTS
------------
This version of Boost is designed for Drupal 6.x running on a Unix platform.
Drupal's clean URLs MUST be enabled and working properly.

The `path' and `pathauto' modules are recommended.

In order for the static files to be correctly expired, the Drupal cron job
must be correctly setup to execute more often than, or as often as, the
cache lifetime interval you specify.

Since the static page caching is implemented with mod_rewrite directives,
Apache version 1.3 or 2.x with mod_rewrite enabled is required (if Drupal's
clean URLs work for you, you're fine; if not, get them working first).
Other web servers, such as Lighttpd, are NOT supported at present.

INSTALLATION
------------

  1. Go to [Administer >> Site configuration >> Clean URLs] and ensure that
     Drupal's clean URLs are enabled and working correctly on your site.

  2. Copy all the module files into a subdirectory called
     sites/all/modules/boost/ under your Drupal installation directory.

  3. Go to [Administer >> Site building >> Modules] and enable the Boost
     module. You will find it in the section labelled "Caching".

  4. Go to [Administer >> Site configuration >> Performance], specify the
     cache directory (must be writable by the web server) and enable static
     caching. Keeping the default directory is highly recommended.

  4. Go to [Administer >> Site configuration >> Performance >> Boost]
     Specify the cache directory, which should be something like
     cache/www.example.com (keeping the default directory is highly recommended)
     and must be writable by the web server: you may need to create the
     directory, and set the permissions so it is writeable. If you choose to use
     gzip, for compression of files cached by Boost, you also specify and may
     need to create the folder for this; the default is of the format
     cache/gz/www.example.com

     On the [Administer >> Site configuration >> Performance] Page is the
     Default minimum cache lifetime setting. As cached pages are created, they
     are given an expire by date and time, which is the current date and time
     plus the minimum cache lifetime. These dates and times are checked on each
     cron run; and if a page is expired, the cache is cleared, and a new cached
     version will be created the next time the page is created by an anonymous
     user (including bots).

  5. IMPORTANT: after backing up the original .htaccess file in your Drupal
     installation directory, add the rules found in boosted1.txt
     right below
       # RewriteBase /
     and above
       # Rewrite URLs of the form 'x' to the form 'index.php?q=x'.
     boosted1.txt is found in the sites/all/modules/boost/htaccess/ directory.
     The default.txt file shows you the exact placement of where the rules go,
     incase your not shure. If you fail to do this step, static page caching
     will NOT work! Rules from boosted1.txt can also be found on the Boost
     Settings page (admin/settings/performance/boost) in the expandable field
     group called "Boost Apache .htaccess settings generation."

     Should you have any trouble getting static pages served using the
     boosted1.txt configuration, try the boosted2.txt file before posting a
     support issue on drupal.org; or try the different radio buttons on the
     admin/settings/performance/boost page under "Boost Apache .htaccess
     settings generation." field group.

     (For the technically inclined, the difference between the two supplied
     .htaccess templates is due to boosted1.txt relying on SERVER_NAME
     versus boosted2.txt using HTTP_HOST. There exist valid use cases for
     both, especially in more advanced, multi-site Drupal installations.)

  6. Log out from Drupal (or use another browser) to browse around your site
     as the anonymous user. Ensure that static files are indeed being
     generated into the Boost cache directory you specified above (#4); and if
     you opt to use gzip, likewise check gzipped files are being generated in
     the directory you specified for this. The performance settings page shows
     how many pages are being cached by Boost, and (for pages Boost cannot
     cache) by Drupal core.

  7. Set $base_url variable in /sites/default/settings.php (line 125 or so)
     so cron runs error free and clears the cache properly when invoked like
     'php /path/to/cron.php' or 'drush cron'. This should be something like
     http://www.example.com

  8. Check the status page [Administer >> Reports >> Status report] for any
     errors or notices.
