REQUIREMENTS
------------
This version of Boost is designed for Drupal 6.x running on a Unix platform.
Drupal's clean URLs MUST be enabled and working properly.

The `path' and `pathauto' modules are recommended.

In order for the static files to be correctly expired, the Drupal cron job
must be correctly setup to execute more often than, or as often as, the
cache lifetime interval you specify.

Since the static page caching is implemented with mod_rewrite directives,
Apache version 1.3 or 2.x with mod_rewrite enabled is required (if Drupal's
clean URLs work for you, you're fine; if not, get them working first).
Other web servers, such as Lighttpd, are NOT supported at present.

INSTALLATION
------------

  1. Go to [Administer >> Site configuration >> Clean URLs] and ensure that
     Drupal's clean URLs are enabled and working correctly on your site.

  2. Copy all the module files into a subdirectory called
     sites/all/modules/boost/ under your Drupal installation directory.

  3. Go to [Administer >> Site building >> Modules] and enable the Boost
     module. You will find it in the section labelled "Caching".

  4. Go to [Administer >> Site configuration >> Performance], specify the
     cache directory (must be writable by the web server) and enable static
     caching. Keeping the default directory is highly recommended.

  5. Log out from Drupal (or use another browser) to browse around your site
     as the anonymous user. Ensure that static files are indeed being
     generated into the Boost cache directory you specified above.

  6. IMPORTANT: after backing up the original .htaccess file in your Drupal
     installation directory, add the rules found in boosted1.txt
     right below
       # RewriteBase /
     and above
       # Rewrite URLs of the form 'x' to the form 'index.php?q=x'.
     boosted1.txt is found in the sites/all/modules/boost/htaccess/ directory.
     The default.txt file shows you the exact placement of where the rules go,
     incase your not shure. If you fail to do this step, static page caching
     will NOT work!

     Should you have any trouble getting static pages served using the
     boosted1.txt configuration, try the boosted2.txt file before posting a
     support issue on drupal.org.

     (For the technically inclined, the difference between the two supplied
     .htaccess templates is due to boosted1.txt relying on SERVER_NAME
     versus boosted2.txt using HTTP_HOST. There exist valid use cases for
     both, especially in more advanced, multi-site Drupal installations.)

  7. Set $base_url variable in /sites/default/settings.php ( 125 line or so )
     so cron runs error free and clears the cache properly when invoked like
     'php5 /path/to/cron.php' or 'drush cron'.
